# todo: create a function that calculates using TimeResolutionCompression.py a compression of XYT
#  coordinates for a given file, then calculates the endpoint nucleators and propagators probabilities.
#  and returns a dictionary with compression level as key and nucleators and propagators probabilities as values.
# todo: create a function that plots (in Visualization.py) the results of probabilites about compression levels.
# todo: perform for all files and select apoptosis and ferroptosis models to show.
